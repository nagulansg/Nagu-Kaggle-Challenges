I am going to try improving my position with time  and learn more about effectively applying algorithms like knowing when to favor a particular one. In addition I will play around with the features before I adjust any algorithm parameters.

### Kaggle Tabular Playground August Series 
- A company has completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. I used this data to build a model that predicts                                          product failures.

### Kaggle Tabular Playground September Series 
- "The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to                                                   forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021." - I built a model to predict book sales                                             when conditions were far from the ordinary. Used xgboost and learnt lots about when to, and when not to use it.

### Last one is still in progress
