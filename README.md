A collection of some of my projects! They are all related to data... because that's what I love working with.

Kaggle Tabular Playground August Series -A company has completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. I used this data to build a model that predicts                                          product failures.

Kaggle Tabular Playground September Series - "The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to                                                   forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021." - I built a model to predict book sales                                             when conditions were far from the ordinary.

BTMA final project - After collecting data using the Spotify API, we performed statistical testing along with visual analytics solutions to answer a few key questions.

OPMA final project - Using webscraped data of job postings regarding data science, my group and I built multiple models utilizing different algorithms to maximize some                       performance metrics and to be able to explain what drives some of the changes in salary.
